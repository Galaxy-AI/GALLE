# GALLM:Galaxy AI Large Language model
 | [English](https://github.com/Galaxy-AI/GALLM/edit/main/README.md) | [中文](https://github.com/Galaxy-AI/GALLM/edit/main/README-zn.md) |
 
GALLM is an open source, bilingual dialogue language model that supports both Chinese and English, based on [LLAMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971v1) Architecture.

GALLM Optimized for Chinese Q&A and dialogue based on LLAMA。After about 2T Chinese identifier training, supplemented by technologies supervised fine-tuning, feedback self-service, and human feedback reinforcement learning，GALLM1.0 We are able to generate responses that align well with human preferences.
