# GALLM:Galaxy AI Large Language model
 | [English](https://github.com/Galaxy-AI/GALLM/edit/main/README.md) | [中文](https://github.com/Galaxy-AI/GALLM/edit/main/README-zn.md) |
 
GALLM is an open source, bilingual dialogue language model that supports both Chinese and English, based on [LLAMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971v1) Architecture.

GALLM Optimized for Chinese Q&A and dialogue based on LLAMA。After about 2T Chinese identifier training, supplemented by technologies such as supervised fine-tuning, feedback self-service, and human feedback reinforcement learning，GALLM1.0 We have been able to generate responses that are quite in line with human preferences.

## What‘s New

- April 24, 2023：GALLM2.0 Publish

GALLM2.0 It is a large-scale language model based on deep learning technology, with a parameter scale of tens of billions, which is even larger than the hundreds of millions level of GALLM1.0. This model uses pre training techniques such as BERT, and incorporates a large number of language models and knowledge bases, making it perform well in semantic understanding, information extraction, text classification, and other aspects. In addition, GALLM2.0 has also been optimized in terms of model structure and algorithm, further improving the performance of the model.
